# Contributing

Please review the [style guide](https://github.com/amclain/styleguides) before submitting a pull request. The guidelines laid out by the style guide are recommendations, not an absolute authority, so use your best judgement if a situation requires that you deviate from the style guide.

Also, please make sure there are automated tests and inline documentation for the code you are contributing.

## New Features

If you are planning to write a new feature that requires a significant investment of time, I recommend creating an issue ticket with your proposal before creating a pull request. This will allow the feature to be discussed and planned out before any time is spent on code that may need to be rewritten.
